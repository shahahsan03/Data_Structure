# Data_Structure

Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and worked with efficiently. They define the relationship between the data, and the operations that can be performed on the data.

# Stack:
A stack is a data structure that stores a collection of items and follows the 'Last In, First Out' (LIFO) rule. This means the last item added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of books, where the book you put on top is the first one you can take off. Stacks are commonly used in computer programming for managing tasks, tracking function calls, and handling actions in a specific order.

# Queue:

A queue is a data structure that works like a line of people waiting for something. It follows the "first-in, first-out" (FIFO) principle, which means the first person to join the line is the first to get served or processed. In a queue, you can add (enqueue) people to the back of the line and remove (dequeue) people from the front of the line. It's like waiting in line at a store: the person who arrives first is the first to be helped, and as more people join, they get in line behind the others.

# Linked Lists
Linked lists are an ordered collection of objects. So what makes them different from normal lists? Linked lists differ from lists in the way that they store elements in memory. While lists use a contiguous memory block to store references to their data, linked lists store references as part of their own elements.

# Binary Tree:
A binary tree is a special type of tree in which every node or vertex has either no child node or one child node or two child nodes. A binary tree is an important class of a tree data structure in which a node can have at most two children.
